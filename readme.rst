Revision 1

This is an Arduino sketch that is meant to be used with the Arduino Mega and
the MakerPlane EIS Sheild Rev 1.

The MakerPlane EIS is an advanced Aircraft engine monitoring system.  It measures
parameters from the engine and communicates that information over CAN-FIX.

Currently the code is not ready for use but we are working on it.
