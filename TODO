High Priority

Read and send EGT and CHT Thermocouples

Send Aux Data for all types

Calculate fuel totalizer

System watchdog timer

Add parameter set to be able to externally set the fuel total and (maybe)
engine time

Store engine / flight timers

Read and send device temperature status

Send the status information from the raw values.  Might have another
configuration key to set a mode where this isn't always done to save
bandwidth on the CAN Bus

Calculate annunciations when values are above or below the warning and alarm
thresholds

Complete the rest of the Analog compute function implementations...
  - 5-Point Interpolated
  - Polynomial
  - Exponential
  - Steinhart-Hart
  - Beta



**************
Low Priority
**************

Deal with the report generation - Need to get all data sending functions moved
to their own functions to finish this.  Including the Aux data.

Read CAN RX overflows from chip and send as status

Read CAN Errors from CAN Chip and send as status.  May need to also clear
errors on the chip.

Actually use the enable/disable parameter feature

Calculate and send CHT/EGT deviations and deviation alarms

Send Values over the serial port in GRT EIS type format.  If there is room
for the code we might have a couple of different format selections.

Warning and Audio outputs

Add serial number to end of flash

Implement the CAN-FIX bootloader

Add Tach time (as opposed to Hobbs time)

Clean up

Move configuration to EEPROM

Remove Serial debugging
